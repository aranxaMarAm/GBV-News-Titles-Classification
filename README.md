## GBV-News-Titles-Classification

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles on gender-based violence into two categories: Episodic (news mentioning direct violence) and Thematic (articles discussing public policy or systemic issues). The dataset almost 1000 labeled news articles from two local media outlets from a my previous bachelor thesis work in the same topic which is available in Spanish and can be consulted [here](https://anuario.coneicc.org.mx/index.php/anuarioconeicc/article/view/633/349). 

In this case, the goal consisted in training a robust classification model to categorize future news articles effectively.


### Key components of the project include:

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data using tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
Feature Extraction: Representing text with TF-IDF vectors and pre-trained embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT).
Model Training: Implementing machine learning models like logistic regression and advanced deep learning models, including transformers (e.g., BERT).
Evaluation: Using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Ethical Considerations: Addressing potential biases in the data and ensuring transparency in model predictions.
This repository contains the code, dataset, and documentation for replicating the analysis and extending it for future research.
