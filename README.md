## NLP: Classifying Gender-Based Violence Frames in News Reporting

This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles on gender-based violence into two categories: Episodic (news mentioning direct violence) and Thematic (articles discussing public policy or systemic issues). The training dataset consists on almost 1000 labeled news articles from two local Mexican media outlets from my previous bachelor thesis work in the same topic which is available in Spanish and can be consulted [here](https://anuario.coneicc.org.mx/index.php/anuarioconeicc/article/view/633/349). 

In this case, the goal consisted in training a classification model to categorize future news articles effectively.


### Key components of the project include:

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data using tokenization and stopword removal.
Feature Extraction: Representing text with TF-IDF vectors and pre-trained embeddings.
Model Training: Implementing  logistic regression.
Evaluation: Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

This repository contains the code, dataset, and documentation for replicating the analysis and extending it for future research.
